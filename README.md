FLASHCARD AI APP
This is my first shot at creating a progressive web app for a business I am starting with some friends. I starting out using express and node.js as my backend server. And using Reactjs for my front end. This app uses open api mainly to gain flash card set material for any topic the user request. I am in the process of making a different version of this which uses Chakra UI components and Firebase for my storage, database, and authentication. The repo is currently private as of right now but I am willing to show what I have done so far if asked. 


THINGS COMPLETED:
Successfully created a login and sign up page.
Created authentication procedure and stored user data in mongoDB.
Successfully created REST API endpoints to communincate to my backend server and OpenAI.
Created a useful navbar and configure protected pages.
